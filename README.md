# IP Mail Notifier
this program is written fully with python and its useful for lots of cases my idea was to get my IP address whenever it is changed 

# Features
this code will loop and check your IP address every minute and if it was changed an email will be sent to the location you choose and will contain ip, location, and so much more...

# Example of output mail
your IP have been changed to 104.194.25.229
